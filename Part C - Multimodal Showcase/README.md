# Multimodal Foundational Models

Link to youtube demo: https://youtu.be/squ814oo3YI?si=fTLYOokKp0fqUPIT

In this section, I demonstrate the multimodal capabilities of 3 multimodal foundational large language models. These include Gemini 1.5, Claude, and Gpt-4o.

I showcase the capabilities of these models' APIs by calling these models with prompts from within a colab environment. The types of data used as input to these models include video, audio, images and text. 10 capabilities of these models are presented within colab across a variety of domains.
