# Testing Claud Dev

Link to youtube demo: https://youtu.be/squ814oo3YI?si=fTLYOokKp0fqUPIT

In this section, 10 use-cases of coding within the VsCode IDE using the Claude Dev extension is presented in the form of a video and code examples. Examples include situations like refactoring, commenting, code generation, autocomplete and more that are simplified with the use of Claud. 

I'll be exemplifying these use-cases using the previously showcased example of End2End software in Part B. The code edits will be made to the original codebase in Part B, and the chat transcript of the edit prompts and Claude's results will be shared here.
