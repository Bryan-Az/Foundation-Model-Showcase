# Long Context Input in Gemini

In this section, I demonstrate Gemini 1.5's new long context input capabilities.  A long, >2 hour video was selected and then summarized into a medium article. This medium article was then used as the basis for creating a LaTex presentation or slideshow - also with Gemini 1.5.

You can watch the video presentation here:
