# Venture Capital Pitch

In this section, I'll be crafting a venture capital pitch and slideshow presentation with the help of Claude 3.5. I'll gather ideas for a potential novel startup project with the help of Claude and then continue developing these ideas. A transcript of the conversation with Claude as well as the pitch and presentation are the uploaded artifacts of this task.
